# Caesar-cipher
 
 Caesar code decryption replaces a letter another with an inverse alphabet shift.It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 
'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet.It is done with a "Passcode".

## Encryption:
At first user give text and passcode. suppose a word is "A" = 1 and passcode is 3 then 1+3=4 [D] then encrypted text is "D".
```
"Plain text from user" + Passcode = "Encrypted message" 
"A[1]"+3[passcode] = 1+3[D] ---- Example
```
## Decryption:
this process is completely diffrent from encryption.User give "Encrypted message" and the passcode that used in encryption process. 
```
"Encrypted message" + Passcode[That used in incryption process] = "Decrypted message" 
"D[4]"-3[passcode] = 4-1 [A] ---- Example
```
